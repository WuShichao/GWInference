# GWInference
------

Welcome to the GWInference online backup. GWInference is a lightweight, yet powerful, pure python gravitational-wave parameter estimation code based around the `emcee` python package created by [Foreman-Mackey, et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.3665.pdf).

### Getting started

If this is your first time using git (or even if it isn't) you may want to check out some of the git tutorials on [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git).

To get access to the code just clone the repo using:

```
git clone git@git.ligo.org:marcus.lower/GWInference.git
```

For more information on	`emcee` and how it works checkout the [website](http://dfm.io/emcee/current/#).

### Contributing

It is not possible to push directly to `master`. In fact, unless you are Marcus Lower, you shouldn't even be able to access this repository. How did you get in here?
