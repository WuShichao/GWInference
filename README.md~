# GWInference
------

Welcome to the GWInference online backup. GWInference is a lightweight, yet powerful, pure python gravitational-wave parameter estimation code 

### Getting started

If this is your first time using git (or even if it isn't) you may want to check out some of the git tutorials on [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git).

To get access to the code just clone the repo using:

```
git clone git@git.ligo.org:marcus.lower/GWInference.git
```

### Contributing

It is not possible to push directly to `master`.
If you have code which you want to be included in the repository it is recommended that you either fork the repository or work on a branch other than `master`.  More information can be found in the repository's [wiki](https://git.ligo.org/Monash/MonashGWTools/wikis/contributing).
